# PostgraphileAuthStarter
Creates a new schema for a postgraphile app with authentication/authorization

Essentially just runs the scripts here https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/postgresql-schema-design/#authentication-and-authorization

Minimally tested, still needs polishing as far as roles and privileges go, use at your own risk

To run: `./run_script.sh <database_name> <schema_name> <owner_name>`
